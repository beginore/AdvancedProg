## Understanding Your Monitoring Setup

[Short introduction explaining the purpose of the response: to describe how the Go application integrates with Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager for monitoring, and to provide improvement suggestions.]

### Go Application Metrics
- Explanation of the Go code’s `/metrics` endpoint using `promhttp.Handler()`.
- Description of custom Prometheus metrics (`httpRequestsTotal`, `httpDuration`).
- Code snippet highlighting the `metricsMiddleware` function.

### Prometheus Configuration
- Overview of Prometheus’ role in scraping metrics from the Go app, `node-exporter`, and `blackbox-exporter`.
- Explanation of `prometheus.yml`:
  - Scrape configs for `prometheus`, `node`, and `blackbox` jobs.
  - Alerting configuration linking to Alertmanager.
- Code snippet of `prometheus.yml`.
- Discussion of the `ForumDown` alert rule in `alert.rules.yml`.

### Grafana Visualization
- Explanation of Grafana’s role in visualizing Prometheus metrics.
- Description of the datasource configuration in `datasource.yml`.
- Suggestions for creating dashboards (e.g., HTTP request rate, response time histograms).

### Alertmanager Notifications
- Overview of Alertmanager’s role in handling alerts.
- Explanation of `alertmanager.yml`:
  - SMTP configuration for Gmail.
  - Routing and receiver setup for email notifications.
- Security note on hardcoded credentials.

### How It All Works Together
- Step-by-step flow:
  1. Go app exposes metrics via `/metrics`.
  2. Prometheus scrapes metrics every 15 seconds.
  3. Grafana queries Prometheus for visualization.
  4. Alertmanager sends email notifications for alerts like `ForumDown`.
- Table comparing roles of Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager.

| Component       | Role                              | Key Configuration File        |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Prometheus     | Scrapes and stores metrics        | prometheus.yml, alert.rules.yml |
| Grafana        | Visualizes metrics                | datasource.yml                |
| Alertmanager   | Handles alerts and notifications  | alertmanager.yml              |

### Suggested Improvements
- **Additional Metrics**: Track database query latency, user actions (e.g., post creation).
- **Alert Rules**: Add alerts for high error rates or slow response times.
- **Grafana Dashboards**: Create dashboards for HTTP metrics and system health.
- **Security**: Use environment variables for SMTP credentials.
- **Blackbox Monitoring**: Expand `blackbox-exporter` probes for other endpoints.

### Potential Issues
- Use of `host.docker.internal` may not work in all environments.
- Hardcoded SMTP credentials pose a security risk.
- Limited alert rules may miss critical issues.

## Next Steps
- Steps to implement suggested improvements:
  1. Add new Prometheus metrics in Go code.
  2. Update `alert.rules.yml` with additional rules.
  3. Configure Grafana dashboards.
  4. Secure Alertmanager credentials using environment variables.
